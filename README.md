# Hearing-Aid-Amplifier-using-LM386
A low-power hearing aid circuit built using the LM386 audio amplifier to amplify weak microphone signals for clearer audibility.
# Overview

This project captures low-level sound through an electret microphone and amplifies it using the LM386 IC.
The circuit delivers a clear audio output through earphones while operating efficiently from a 9V battery.
# Components Used

Electret microphone

LM386 audio amplifier IC

Resistors & capacitors

10 kΩ potentiometer (volume control)

Earphones

9V battery

# Working Principle

1. Microphone converts sound to a weak electrical signal.

2. LM386 amplifies the signal with adjustable gain.

3. Coupling/bypass capacitors reduce noise and distortion.

4. Amplified audio is output to earphones.
# Features

Compact and low-power design

Clear and stable audio amplification

Beginner-friendly analog circuit
